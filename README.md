ABSTRACT:

• In this project, we're tackling the problem of fake news using computer smarts. 
We're creating a tool that learns to tell the difference between real and fake stories on the 
internet. By teaching the computer about how real news looks and spotting tricky words, 
we hope to build a strong system. 
• We're using special techniques to clean up messy data and making the computer look at 
important details in news articles. Our project uses the power of deep learning and smart 
combinations of methods to be super effective. We'll test our tool a lot to make sure it 
works well in real situations. 
• Our goal is to make a tool that not only spots fake news but also explains why it thinks 
something is fishy. This way, people can trust and understand how it works. We hope our 
project helps make the online world a safer and more reliable place. 
 
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

• Our project focuses on developing a robust solution for detecting fake news on the 
internet using advanced computer techniques. Fake news has become a big problem, 
spreading misinformation and confusing people. We aim to create a tool that can 
automatically figure out if a news story is real or fake. 
• To do this, we're using the power of computers to learn from lots of examples of real and 
fake news. We'll teach the computer to pay attention to certain words and patterns that are 
common in fake stories. The project involves cleaning up messy data (making it neat and 
organized) and using smart methods to analyze news articles. 
• We're not just stopping at detection; we want our tool to be good at explaining why it 
thinks something is fake. This way, people can trust the tool and understand how it's 
making its decisions. We'll be testing our tool thoroughly to make sure it works well in 
different situations. 
• Ultimately, our project aims to contribute to a safer online environment by helping people 
identify and avoid fake news. By combining computer smarts with user-friendly 
explanations, we hope to make a positive impact in the fight against misinformation.
